        <h2>Every Kidchef's Favorite</h2>
        <p>The mudpie is usually one of the first dishes that children
            will learn and master. Many will discount it as easy and only for beginners,
            but the mud pie is deceiving.  Yes, it will be great when done
            simply, but the extensions and additions are endless, allowing even 
            the most skilled kidchefs to be challenged and to show off their skills.</p>
